## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing the faculty data of NUML's Department of Computer Science (CS) and Department of Software Engineering (SE). The analysis focuses on comparing faculty members across various aspects such as:

- The number of faculty members in each department.
- Designation-wise comparison (e.g., Associate Professors, Assistant Professors, and Lecturers).
- PhD qualification comparison.
- Comprehensive list of all faculty members with their designations, department, and contact information.

The workflow of this project includes the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Scraped faculty data from the NUML website for both CS and SE departments.
   - Organized data into a structured format.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Cleaned and formatted the data (e.g., handling missing fields, standardizing designations).
   - Categorized faculty members by their designations and departments.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Performed comparisons between the CS and SE departments on:
     - Total number of faculty members.
     - Designation distribution (Lecturers, Assistant Professors, Associate Professors).
     - Number of PhD-qualified faculty members.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Created visualizations to illustrate:
     - Faculty distribution in CS and SE departments.
     - Designation-wise comparison.
     - PhD qualification comparison.
     - List of all faculty members with their designations, departments, and contact details, color-coded as follows:
       - **Red**: Lecturer
       - **Yellow**: Associate Professor
       - **Orange**: Assistant Professor
